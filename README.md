# project-project
Project-project is a project management application.
Actually now it's mostly just a todo app.

## CURRENT

This project is now split into 2 completely separate parts.

1) A set of scripts that compiles a wiki
2) A todo app

The todo app will be made into an application. 
Basically what happens with this is: you can write todo tasks for
days, weeks, and months. You can categorize them. And you can do
all this with a pleasant UI and VIM KEYBINDINGS.

The wiki generation stuff can already be aliased to something like `wiki`.
It just makes a bunch of links.

## Initial Brainstorming 

- todo app
  - "better version of trello"
    - categories of tasks 
    - can move stuff with vim keybindings (shift+v for block select, then x, then p)
    - subtasks
  - time categories:
    - "whenever I have free time" / back burner
    - monthly summary
    - weekly summary
    - daily breakdowns, optional time stamps
  - vim text areas: "jakub-m thing on github"
  - markdown
    - "preview mode"
    - text highlighting

- progress indicator
  - finished stuff

- fancy graphics
  - cool color scheme
    - but you can plug in yourr own custom css file if you feel like it
  - random animmations 

- wiki thing
  - e.g. documentation
  * enchanted forest
    - Bob character page. 
      - Bob is a _levancer_. He hates _Malimost_.
      - **Bob is a pro**.
